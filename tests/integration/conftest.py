"""Integration-suite setup: requires a real InkyPi checkout.

Point ``INKYPI_PATH`` at a jtn0123/InkyPi checkout and this suite runs against
the real host — the real ``BasePlugin``, the real plugin registry, the real
``Config``. Without it every test here is skipped, so a bare ``pytest`` from a
clean clone still exits green having run the unit suite.

The plugin folder must also be reachable at ``<inkypi>/src/plugins/layout``
(symlink or copy) — that's how InkyPi's own loader finds a plugin, and
``BasePlugin`` resolves ``render_dir``/``get_plugin_dir`` relative to it.
